👀 What I’m passionate about:
I’m really into cybersecurity, especially the areas of threat detection, threat hunting, and system monitoring. Over the years, I’ve worked with a variety of tools and languages like Python, Bash, PowerShell, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and some PHP.

🌱 What I’m working on:
Right now, I’m diving deeper into the Blue Team side of things. I’m focusing on analysis, threat detection, threat hunting, and the always-important world of audit and compliance. I’m also experimenting with AI and its potential to improve cybersecurity operations, making things more efficient for security teams.

Aside from that, I’ve got an interest in the more technical side too – like developing info stealer tools, figuring out AMSI bypass methods, and using Living off the Land (LOTL) techniques. My goal is to build tools and scripts that help improve SIEM operations (like Splunk) and develop open-source solutions for smaller businesses that might not have the budget for full-blown SIEM solutions or SOC teams. It’s all about helping these companies boost their security posture.

💼 My Skills:

Languages: Python, Bash, PowerShell, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, basic PHP

What I Focus On: Threat detection and hunting, cybersecurity frameworks (like MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, and CIS), system monitoring, log analysis, and automation. I’m also keen on developing audit & compliance tools (like ISO 27001).
💞️ What I’m looking to collaborate on:
If you’re working on projects that involve threat detection, log analysis, security automation, or building tools for compliance, I’d love to connect. I’m also always open to contributing to open-source security projects.
