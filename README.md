👋 Hi, I’m @wRabit

👀 Interests: I'm passionate about cybersecurity, with a focus on threat detection, threat hunting, and system monitoring. I have experience with Python, Bash, PowerShell, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL and basic PHP.

🌱 Currently Exploring: : I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast diving deeper into Blue Team activities. I’m expanding my skills in analysis, threat hunting, threat detection, and audit and compliance. While tools like Sysmon provide valuable logs for analysts, my focus is on building tools and scripts to improve SIEM operations (e.g., Splunk). I’m particularly passionate about developing open-source solutions for smaller companies that might lack the budget for enterprise SIEM solutions or SOC teams, to help them to improve their security posture.

💼 Skills:

Languages: Python, Bash, PowerShell, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, basic PHP
Focus Areas: Threat detection and hunting, cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CIS), system monitoring, log analysis, and automation. I’m also keen on building audit & compliance tools (e.g., ISO 27001).
💞️ Collaboration: I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to threat detection, log analysis, security automation, and compliance tools. I’m also open to contributing to open-source security projects.
